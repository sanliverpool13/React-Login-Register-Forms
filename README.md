# What Was Used 
Project was generated with 'npx create-react-app <project-name>' command.
CSS Modules were used for styling components. The modules were placed locally for each 
component, in its folder.
React-Router-Dom was used to render different components due to url change.
Error Handling for Register and Login forms were done by error handler functions placed in a 
separate file for each form, in its own folder.

# How To Run
Simply clone repository and then run 'npm install'.
